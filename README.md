Backbone challenge #1


The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

    Only one disk can be moved at a time.
    Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
    No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

With three disks, the puzzle can be solved in seven moves.
